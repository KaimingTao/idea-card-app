## Models help us think

- Model is also called *knowledge*, *understanding*
- Models reflects different ways of seeing or thinking.
- Linguistical, mathematical, physical, philosophical, economical, biological, sociological, theological, theories, principles, axioms, assumptions are all some kinds of models.

tags: Theory

## How we know if a model is correct

- Some of the models are proved by numerous evidences
- Some are not proved but people believe they're right
- Some cannot be proved because it's hard
- Models are just thinking tools, if one model doesn't work, try others.

- Finally we can grasp some tricks or general methods.
- Also the process of breaking complex to simple, then rebuild from bottom to top is a natural way to be better.

## How to set goals

- Find something we want to try, hobbies, trends, we can also borrow from other people's ideas
- Try, and have fun. We need some feedback from others, see some consequences.
- We want to know if we're thinking or doing in the right way. Are they what we expect or like or wish?
- Reevaluation our goals, if they're still what we want to do. If not, try a new one

## Different people understand things differently

- Because the world is big
- Because people see things from different angles

- We don't have to know all, we just need the thing helps us.

tags: Understanding

## Memorizing is not understanding

- Forgetting is ok, if we never use them or won't use them
- As long as we know how to use knowledge to achieve our goal, it's ok

## The mind model don't have to be perfect

## Note taking is to help us think

Without this in mind, using any tool is aiming for a problematic goal that takes myriads of time for perfection but achieving nothing.
- People often take a lot of notes, and use fancy tools
- We need tools that make think clearly and easily, not a fancy tool

tags: Noting

---

## Note taking community has some common errors.

- In the note-taking community the hot topics are always about tools, methods, etc... which is misleading.
- I guess sometimes people get confused by their notes and the things they want to publish.
- Notes are drafts of thinking, scattered pieces.
- If we check the published drafts by famous designers, they're obscure and incomprehensible, because that fits to their ways of thinking, not designed for others.

tags: Noting

## AI noting is meaningless.

- Using AI to take notes means, lack of thinking, it's not note taking.

- The number of ways to combine ideas or knowledge is bigger bigger bigger than the number of atoms in this universe
- For achieving a goal, the purpose is not to build a library that contains everything, and that thing won't exist in this world anyway
- The key question is what are **information**, what are **noise**, noises won't help us think

## Note taking is for doing something

- When we take notes, we also collect some documents, files.

## How to organize notes

- Don't take too many times, make it as simple as possible
- Notes are for thinking, as long as you can use the notes for your work, the whole thing is in good shape.
- Until you cannot use it think, then some cleanup work is required. (I doubt it)
- Notes which organized by project is better than organize then in topics, because project is our goal, not traditional topics.
- For notes we don't know where to categorize it, save then using today's date.
- Duplication of ideas is not a problem, ideas under different topics have different connotation, because the context are different.
- Scattered ideas are ok, find a tool to searching them.

- The vital questions is, which things we care the most, we need safely keep them.

tags: Data management

## How to categorize files

- Files and data should be separated into these categories for reducing confusion for ourselves
- Personal file and data
- Project data
- Other data collections

tags: Data management

---

## Organize project files

- Project can stay for a long time, some ideas were tried, something is in pending, something is deleted.
- Organizing files by date is a good option.
- Organizing files by projects, not sub, sub projects, sub projects expends search time.
- Things are evolving, so the best way is starting from what we're doing

tags: Data management

---

## Don't store data in your PC or Mac or computer

- When your computer got lost, you lost everything
- Have some backup using cloud storage, local external HDD (not SSD)
- Although backing up files are boring, losting data is the irresolvable trouble, more sever problem.

tags: Data management

---

## If you're good at using computer, consider to have a NAS like server

- I **DON'T** recommend any commercial NAS products, just use Linix + Samba + encrypted HDD is enough
- Have 3 copy of your data, one in the computer, two offline
- You don't have to keep the NAS 24/7, only when you need it
- Don't use big disk like 10T+, the problems is mirroring the disk is slow, and when a harddisk is broken, you need waste hours to rebuild it from new one.
- SSD is not good for long time off-power storage, lost data.

tags: Data management

---

## Consider use some cloud data storage

- Only for non sensitive data
- Commercial cloud storage services promise they will encrypt your data, but you cannot prove it, they cannot neither
- If encryption algorithms get broken by quantum computer, none of your data is safe
- Expect you data will be accessed by unknown person in the future

tags: Data management

---

## For data security, no absolutely safe solution exists, but some are better than others

- The best way for data security is to not record the data, but we need record something
- The second best way for data security is to keep data always offline. It won't prevent you from lossing data at home, like computer failure.
- If you want to share files between different computers in local Wi-Fi network, NAS or customized NAS is good enough. You'll still face software glitch occationally.

tags: Data management

---

## If you want to share files remotely, some cloud storage service is good enough.

- Choose the service that claim the encrypt the data, don't fully trust them because it's a black box
- The cloud storage is mostly bigger than the storage size of your local computer, so the true file won't be stored in your local machine, it's just a placeholder
- When you access it, the software will download it. Which means for file you always want to access even without internet, It's not a good solution.

tags: Data management

---

## For important data, store self-encrypted version in cloud service, and also a local copy.

tags: Data management

---

## Personal data storage is a distributed system.

- We store data in our phones, computers, or cloud services. Hence it's distributed everywhere. So, folder or files that are copies won't be updated at the same time.
- We cannot be sure all of them can be accessed all the time. Even we have a method to synchornize all devices, it may fail and some backup may broken.
- We should accept it, and make sure the important thing is to use our data to finish our work. Not pay to much time to make the system perfect, because it won't.

## Simple tips to solve hard questions

- Don't be afraid of things that's hard, and know our limitation in present
- Relax and calm help us think and make good decisions, that doesn't mean tension is bad, depends on context
- If the mind is always in tension, soon it will feel burnout and will damage the mind
- Try to be analytical to the serious questions we're facing
- Split hard questions into simple things you can understand
- When hard problems are split to manageable ones we can estimate if we can solve the puzzle and how long it takes
- Be patient
- Have some fun of thinking or doing something
- Change angles of seeing things, try different ways
- If you find you're on the wrong path of thinking , stop, and consider another paths
- Thinking about the consequence if we plan to do or not to do
- Is the thing important?
- Is the consequence important?
- Collect or build some handy tools, physical tools or thinking tools
- Note down sometime we feel important or deserve some work in the future

## Do things efficiently

- Work can fit into some workflows which constructed by steps
- Some workflows are efficient others are not
- Many inefficient big solutions at beginning is efficient
- After years it cannot fit new situations, people keeping adding things and forget cleaning up, some steps is not necessary anymore
- A workflow is a communication chain
- **If you understand how to communicate efficiently then you know how to do things efficiently**
- Make a plan, if possible some backup plans

## Different perspectives and what could be true

- Our eyes and ears are faciing forward, that's why we cannot see our back and ourselves.
- The data we perceived is distorted by our sense
- Optical illusion is an example of what we see is not what's really happened
- Our mind will change the data we perceived
- A phenomenon called "selective attention test" shows we can ignore things when we're watching
- visual magic tricks is another example
- Different people see things in different angle, I call it `point of view`, it's a bit like the "allegory of the cave"

tags: Theory

## Don't take for granted

- People like to read detective stories, in these stories, the famous detective can always see what others ignored

tags: Mindset

## If what we see may not true, how can we know something is true?

- by repeated testing it
- I see run rise everyday so I know it will rise tomorrow
- I know without food I cannot live it's proved by history
- I don't know if extraterrestrial civilizations exists, because it's hard to prove, and for now, it's not important
- It's similar to when we cannot see things clearly we will try to see it twice or three times to confirm it
- things we can't repeated test is hard to be verified
- What other people feel we may not know anyway, but we can understand other people's mind by experience, or through their point of view, or reasoning
- Most of the time, we need make decisions even with incomplete information, and get incomplete information is common, complete is hard
- That's another reason we may see something not real, because the information is not complete
- All good products will be tested thousands or tens of thousands of times to check it's reliability

## Basic skills of a person

- Take care of our dail life
- Cook or prepare food for ourselves
- keep body healthy
- keep mind healthy
- Learn how to manage the assets
- Learn how to do self improve, more than 90% we should rely on self learning, solving the problem by ourselves, searching answers by ourselves, it's more efficient
- It's the eager to learn drive us learn more, not a teacher push us to learn
- Learn how to be psychologically independent
- Learn how to lead ourselves
- Be self driven

I found that some people learnt when they're young, some are still struggling when they're old, and being the obstacle in their life. So I think they're basic skills for living.

## Teachers help us pass some barriers when we don't know where to go, they have experience about these things

- it's high probably for things we're interested we cannot find a teacher
- so we rely on self study
- solving the problem by ourselves
- searching answers by ourselves

## Learning and understanding

- We're in a period of time that we can access many information online, so learn something is easy?
- No. the internet is still lacking of many informations, because a lot of them cannot be digitalized.
- Or even it's digitalized you don't have the mind to understand them.
- The thing is we can have the goal to achieve the learning and solve our real problem, we go step by step small and small, one day we can finish the goal, that's the purpose of learning.
- The purpose of learning is not to memorize things and we won't use it definitely in the future.
- Although if it's your hobby, feel happy about learning it is a good experience.
- Of course to prepare some tools for future is not a bad idea like the regular school.
- We need driven by ourselves, or better lead by ourselves.
- Then we would be a psychologically independent person.

tags: Learning

## Learning and trying

- we learn things by experiencing and by do something
- I'd ask myself why I need learn this once in a while, to check my goal
- It's like asking `I do this thing for what?`
- If the goal is not clear, it's hard to see which way I'll walk
- A better way of learning I think is not memorizing things, it's thinking about how to use them in different context, and understand the logic
- Knowledge are not isolated
- Learning is a step by step walk
- Understanding advanced ideas requires some basic understanding
- That's why experience is essential for understanding
- Build yourself a handy knowledge library
- Any noting tools that cannot help us think is useless
- If we note a lot but won't use them, the notes feel sad
- We need tools that makes our mind clear, not a fancy tool which is misleading
- Learn from people's goodness and badness
- Know if they're knowledge is good for us

- We changes when we think differently'

## Perfectionist is not needed

to be better is not about to be perfect, it's about to be better than solve
the real question easier. the definition of perfect is always changing, hence
hard to be a goal. A goal should be a stable, reachable milestone, not a always
moving which cannot be caught.

## Thinker and doer

A common idea is that thinker and doer are different types of people.
Here, I introduce a new idea of what are their differences.

Simplest to say, thinker is focused more on the processing of data, less on generating
output. Doer is focused on doing something and checking it's feedback.

## What is Experience?

- Experience includes the historical data we sense, we think, and the things we have done
- Experience cannot be copied from others
- It's hard to explain something to people who lack the experience
- I cannot explain the taste of salted ducks I cooked
- I cannot recall the song I haven't heard
- We would hear other people's experience and knowledge
- But some details cannot be fully explained
- Personal experience is still essential for understanding
- And we need to know if the knowledge fits us or not (good or bad)
- Some people claim they know almost everything
- Comparing to 100 billion homo sapiens existed in history, it's just a drop of water in the ocean
- I cannot understand everything even for things I like to do
- I am limited by time and space
- But for things I care I want to learn more
- I'd be open minded to learn new things
- Some experiences won't have any consequence
- It's like passing through a stranger and we won't meet again
- In that way I'll rethink what I'm doing

tags: Communicate

## What is Think?

- Mind creates models which are simulations of real or virtual world
- Models don't have to fit what is real
- In physical world, the physics theories are good models
- In fictional stories, magics, humanoid animals, mythologies are using different logic
- Simulations help us predict what will happen, and make decisions
- Models, hence the **mindset** reflects how we see the world
- *Emotion is also one kind of thinking*
- High level (abstract) understanding is built from some basic understanding, that's what I call `level of understanding`
- If the abstract knowledge helps in real world, I'd consider it's necessary, otherwise I would say thinking too abstract things is not good
- I prefer not to build non-pragmatic abstract models
- Mind has limitations by time and space
- What's why we need focus on information not noise
- The purpose of thinking is to comprehend things and be smart
- But confusion is common, or say it's default, we start from unknown in learning process
- How mind works is a **solved** problem
- Some people think `how mind works` is an unsolved problem, but it's not
- Some experienced people they own knowledge of how mind works, they can predict other people's mind
- Yes, the biological details are not fully known

tags: Communicate

## What is Sense

- sense is for collecting data for thinking
- I use `data`, `knowledge`, `information` interchangeably
- human body can sense different kinds of information
- vision, hearing, tasting, smell, touch, comfort, humidity, etc
- vision and hearing catch our focus more than others
- sense can be complex and advanced
- there is a phenomenon called synesthesia when people hear music they can see colors, when see a picture of food they can feel the taste
- we can feel how we use our body, and how our body works in sports
- we can feel how we think, how our mind is working
- sense can distort what is real
- what we see is not always what is real
- different people feel same things in different way

tags: Communicate

---

## What is Action

- If we only think but do nothing, thinking is wasted
- we use mind to determine what is the goal
- we use mind to determine how to do
- trial and error is an efficient way to test our ideas
- there're multiple ways to do one job, but the costs are different
- travel from A to B we can walk, drive, take a plane, take a boat, dig a hole if it's on the other side of the sphere
- we shall estimate the cost and choose some of the affordable options.
- all action have consequences
- that help us make serious of choices if we should use one way or others'

## Some good ways of thinking

- have fun of thinking something interesting
- don't be afraid of things you cannot understand

- try to be relax and calm
- if the mind is always in tension, soon the burnout occurs and damage the mind
- try to be analytical to the issue you're facing
- Thinking about the consequence if we do or don't do something
- is the thing we wanna do important?
- is the consequence important?
- learn from others their goodness and badness
- be open minded

## Our sense collect data from the environment. In this internet world, the data are tooooo much

- things important are **information**, others are **noise**
- In network society, the data are tooooo much
- modern information system makes people expose to noises, it's deliberately designed like that
- before modern world, the issue was there too
- why way to know if noise exists, is to test if we're confused
- focus less on noise, it's wasting the time, and wasting the mind spirit, which will do harm to mind
- for different people what defines as **noise** are different
- we need to learn how to distinguish noise, and focus on what we really care
- Thinking about what we really want to achieve, we can learn what is noise and how to block noise

## Who we can help?
